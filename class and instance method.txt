in Model of my_app
we have many classes that generated for Users 
such as Informations, Education_histories, and Specializations
each class having thier data 
for Users it's include name, username, and email
for Informations it's include user_id, address, and phone
for Education_histories it's include user_id, university, and stage
lastly, for Specializations it's include user_id, major, and degree
-------------------------------------------------------------------
after generation validated and associated the data in the classes 
Users,Informations, Education_histories, and Specializations
-------------------------------------------------------------------
examples :
first User
name: Lina, username:Lina95, email:Lina@gmail.com, address:Baghdad, phone:0747896, 
university:Mustansiriyah University, stage:one, major:Engineering, degree:verygood 
second User
name: Mina, username:Mina94, email:Mina@gmail.com, address:Erbil, phone:0782805, 
university:Erbil University, stage:third, major:Medicine, degree:good 
third User
name: Dania, username:Dania90, email:Dania@gmail.com, address:Anbar, phone:0794326, 
university:Anbar University, stage:forth, major:Science, degree:verygood 
-------------------------------------------------------------------
in my_app :
(name, username, email, address, phone, university, stage, major, and degree ) 
all of these between the brackets above are attributes
-------------------------------------------------------------------
define class method 

for class method 
1- choose the class that we have to add class method  
in Model> Class_name.rb such as User.rb or Information.rb or any other class_name 
2- typing 
def self.method_name
    attribute or/and any other function
end
note : self this is mean for the self class we choose the method 
wil works for all objects or attributes in the same class

when call up in Terminal:
Class_name.method_name

example:
for Information class
def self.location
    address
end
call up 
Information.location
---------------------------------------------------------------------
define instance method

for instance method
1- choose the class that we have to add instance method 
in Model> Class_name.rb such as User.rb or Information.rb or any other class_name 
2- typing 
def method_name
    attribute or/and any other function
end
note: when remove self from the definiation, that's mean it's instanse method and 
it's works only for one objects or attributes in the same class

when call up in Terminal:
Class_name.find(xx).method_name

example: 
for Specialization class
def the_average
    degree
end
call up
Specialization.find(2).the_average
-------------------------------------------------------------------
if we convert from instance method to class method

1- choose the class that we have to convert instance method to class method  
in Model> Class_name.rb such as User.rb or Information.rb or any other class_name 
2- typing 
def self.method_name
    self.method.attribute or/and any other function
end
when call up in Terminal:
Class_name.method_name

example: 
for Education_history 
def self.name_of_uni
    self.second.university
end
when call up in Terminal:
Education_history.name_of_uni
---------------------------------------------------------------------
scope
example
scope for a degree in a Specializations class

scope :scope_method, -> { where(attributes: data_of_attributes) }
scope :degree_verygood, -> { where(degree: verygood) }

when call up in Terminal:
Class_name.scope_method
Specialization.degree_verygood
